Sometimes I like to create some personal projects to learn new technologies and be
updated and give my bit to the community.

When I started working with node, I was working on an existing application, so I was
always curious about how I could create a service from scratch, so guess what? I made my own!
I leave it below if you want to take a look at it and if you want to contact me to give me
feedback or talk about it you know where I am!

Some time ago I discovered the github actions, I started to use them in many
projects and I also made some of my own, they are not much but I am glad that there
are people who see them useful and are using them.

I am a big fan of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://insomnia.rest/">Insomnia </a>
application, for me it is the best client to make REST requests to services. And you know the best
thing? You can create your own plugins so I couldn't resist
to make some!
